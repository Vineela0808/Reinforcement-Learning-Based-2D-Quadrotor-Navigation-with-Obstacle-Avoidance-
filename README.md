# Reinforcement-Learning-Based-2D-Quadrotor-Navigation-with-Obstacle-Avoidance
ROB 6323 Reinforcement Learning and Optimal Control for Robotics || Project - PPO || Fall 2024

## Abstract
This Project focuses on 2D quadrotor control using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to navigate towards a target while avoiding obstacles. The implementation involves creating a custom simulation environment using the stable-baselines3 library and training RL agent with the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. The quadrotor's dynamics are modeled using a nonlinear system of equations, where control inputs are optimized for stable flight anf obstacle avoidance. Through extensive tarining, the RL-based controller learns efficient navigation policies, making real-time decisions to maneuver the quadrotor safely. The results demonstrate the feasibility of RL-based control in complex aerial navigation tasks
